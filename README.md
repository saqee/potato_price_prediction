 Potato Price Prediction using Linear Regression


Potato Price Prediction — Machine Learning with Linear Regression Developed a predictive model to estimate potato prices based on weight data using Linear Regression in Python. Implemented data preprocessing, train-test split, model fitting, and accuracy evaluation with R² score. Analyzed results and identified the impact of non-linear patterns on prediction performance.

Key Skills: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Data Visualization, Model Evaluation The dataset contains sample values of potato weight vs. market price. The project includes:

Data preprocessing and handling missing values

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

Model training with LinearRegression()

Model evaluation using R² score

Visualization of regression line vs. actual data

Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
