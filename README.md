 Potato Price Prediction using Linear Regression


A simple machine learning project that predicts potato prices based on weight (in kilograms) using Scikit-learn’s Linear Regression. The dataset contains sample values of potato weight vs. market price. The project includes:

Data preprocessing and handling missing values

Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

Model training with LinearRegression()

Model evaluation using R² score

Visualization of regression line vs. actual data

Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
